# Find the nearest taxi

  Imagine a track from 0 to 1000 km on which there are 1-10 taxi cars and one passenger
  
  Create a passenger by variable $passenger = rand (0, 1000)
  
  We create an array $cars with 5-10 taxi cars, with a random location on the highway from 0 to 1000 km and a random load (busy/free).
  
  Calculate which of the five cars is closest to the passenger and is free and goes to him

##### Output example:
  Output example:
  
  The passenger at 792km
  
  Taxi 1 at 370km, distance to the passenger 422km (busy)
  
  Taxi 2 at 87km, distance to the passenger 705km (busy)
  
  Taxi 3 at 426km, distance to the passenger 366km (free)
  
  Taxi 4 at 628km, distance to the passenger 164km (free) - this taxi is going
  
  Taxi 5 at 515km, distance to the passenger 277km (busy)
  
  Taxi 6 at 240km, distance to the passenger 552km (free)
