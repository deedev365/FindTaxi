# Find the nearest taxi

  Imagine a track from 0 to 1000 km on which there are 1-10 taxi cars and one passenger
  Create a passenger by variable $passenger = rand (0, 1000)
  We create an array $cars with 5-10 taxi cars, with a random location on the highway from 0 to 1000 km and a random load (busy/free).
  Calculate which of the five cars is closest to the passenger and is free and goes to him

##### Output example:

  Taxi 1 at 635 km, distance to the passenger 253 km (free) 
  Taxi 2 at 185 km, distance to the passenger 197 km (free) 
  Taxi 3 at 897 km, distance to the passenger 515 km (free) 
  Taxi 4 at 508 km, distance to the passenger 126 km (free) - this taxi is going
  Taxi 5 at 695 km, distance to the passenger 313 km (busy)
