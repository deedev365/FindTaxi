# Find the nearest taxi

Imagine a track from 0 to 1000 km on which there are 1-10 taxi cars and one passenger

Create a passenger by variable $passenger = rand (0, 1000)

We create an array $cars with 5-10 taxi cars, with a random location on the highway from 0 to 1000 km and a random load (busy/free).

Calculate which of the five cars is closest to the passenger and is free and goes to him

##### Output example:

Taxi 1, stands at 635 km, up to a passenger 253 km (free)
Taxi 2, stands at 185 km, up to a passenger 197 km (free)
Taxi 3, stands at 897 km, up to a passenger 515 km (free)
Taxi 4, stands at 508 km, 126 km to the passenger (free) - this taxi is going
Taxi 5, stands at 695 km, 313 km to the passenger (busy)
